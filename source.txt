<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="0" id="t-0000">When I was nine years old,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="2000" id="t-2000">I went off to summer camp for the first time.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="4167" id="t-4167">And my mother packed me a suitcase full of books,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="8000" id="t-8000">which to me seemed like a perfectly natural thing to do.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="10691" id="t-10691">Because in my family, reading was the primary group activity.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="15000" id="t-15000">And this might sound antisocial to you,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="17000" id="t-17000">but for us it was really just a different way of being social.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="20000" id="t-20000">You have the animal warmth of your family sitting right next to you,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="24000" id="t-24000">but you are also free to go roaming around the adventureland</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="26882" id="t-26882">inside your own mind.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="28000" id="t-28000">And I had this idea</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="30000" id="t-30000">that camp was going to be just like this, but better.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="32548" id="t-32548">(Laughter)</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="35000" id="t-35000">I had a vision of 10 girls sitting in a cabin</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="38000" id="t-38000">cozily reading books in their matching nightgowns.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="40405" id="t-40405">(Laughter)</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="42000" id="t-42000">Camp was more like a keg party without any alcohol.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="45000" id="t-45000">And on the very first day,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="48000" id="t-48000">our counselor gathered us all together</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="50000" id="t-50000">and she taught us a cheer that she said we would be doing</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="52700" id="t-52700">every day for the rest of the summer to instill camp spirit.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="56000" id="t-56000">And it went like this:</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="58000" id="t-58000">"R-O-W-D-I-E,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="60000" id="t-60000">that's the way we spell rowdie.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="62000" id="t-62000">Rowdie, rowdie, let's get rowdie."</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="65417" id="t-65417">(Laughter)</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="67000" id="t-67000">Yeah.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="69000" id="t-69000">So I couldn't figure out for the life of me</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="71072" id="t-71072">why we were supposed to be so rowdy,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="73000" id="t-73000">or why we had to spell this word incorrectly.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="76000" id="t-76000">(Laughter)</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="82000" id="t-82000">But I recited a cheer. I recited a cheer along with everybody else.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="85215" id="t-85215">I did my best.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="87000" id="t-87000">And I just waited for the time that I could go off and read my books.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="92560" id="t-92560">But the first time that I took my book out of my suitcase,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="95384" id="t-95384">the coolest girl in the bunk came up to me</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="97424" id="t-97424">and she asked me, "Why are you being so mellow?" --</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="99900" id="t-99900">mellow, of course, being the exact opposite</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="101972" id="t-101972">of R-O-W-D-I-E.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="103899" id="t-103899">And then the second time I tried it,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="105800" id="t-105800">the counselor came up to me with a concerned expression on her face</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="109000" id="t-109000">and she repeated the point about camp spirit</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="111120" id="t-111120">and said we should all work very hard to be outgoing.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="114354" id="t-114354">And so I put my books away,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="117000" id="t-117000">back in their suitcase,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="120000" id="t-120000">and I put them under my bed,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="124000" id="t-124000">and there they stayed for the rest of the summer.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="126400" id="t-126400">And I felt kind of guilty about this.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="128200" id="t-128200">I felt as if the books needed me somehow,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="130200" id="t-130200">and they were calling out to me and I was forsaking them.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="133000" id="t-133000">But I did forsake them and I didn't open that suitcase again</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="135900" id="t-135900">until I was back home with my family at the end of the summer.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="139000" id="t-139000">Now, I tell you this story about summer camp.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="142000" id="t-142000">I could have told you 50 others just like it --</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="145000" id="t-145000">all the times that I got the message</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="147000" id="t-147000">that somehow my quiet and introverted style of being</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="151000" id="t-151000">was not necessarily the right way to go,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="153000" id="t-153000">that I should be trying to pass as more of an extrovert.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="156000" id="t-156000">And I always sensed deep down that this was wrong</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="159000" id="t-159000">and that introverts were pretty excellent just as they were.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="161882" id="t-161882">But for years I denied this intuition,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="164000" id="t-164000">and so I became a Wall Street lawyer, of all things,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="167000" id="t-167000">instead of the writer that I had always longed to be --</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="170000" id="t-170000">partly because I needed to prove to myself that I could be bold and assertive too.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="174000" id="t-174000">And I was always going off to crowded bars</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="176101" id="t-176101">when I really would have preferred to just have a nice dinner with friends.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="179697" id="t-179697">And I made these self-negating choices so reflexively,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="184000" id="t-184000">that I wasn't even aware that I was making them.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="187497" id="t-187497">Now this is what many introverts do,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="189300" id="t-189300">and it's our loss for sure,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="191000" id="t-191000">but it is also our colleagues' loss</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="193000" id="t-193000">and our communities' loss.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="195000" id="t-195000">And at the risk of sounding grandiose, it is the world's loss.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="198000" id="t-198000">Because when it comes to creativity and to leadership,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="201000" id="t-201000">we need introverts doing what they do best.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="204000" id="t-204000">A third to a half of the population are introverts --</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="206548" id="t-206548">a third to a half.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="208000" id="t-208000">So that's one out of every two or three people you know.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="211000" id="t-211000">So even if you're an extrovert yourself,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="214000" id="t-214000">I'm talking about your coworkers</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="216000" id="t-216000">and your spouses and your children</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="218000" id="t-218000">and the person sitting next to you right now --</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="221000" id="t-221000">all of them subject to this bias</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="223000" id="t-223000">that is pretty deep and real in our society.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="225120" id="t-225120">We all internalize it from a very early age</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="228000" id="t-228000">without even having a language for what we're doing.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="231000" id="t-231000">Now, to see the bias clearly,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="233000" id="t-233000">you need to understand what introversion is.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="236000" id="t-236000">It's different from being shy.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="238000" id="t-238000">Shyness is about fear of social judgment.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="240000" id="t-240000">Introversion is more about,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="242000" id="t-242000">how do you respond to stimulation,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="244000" id="t-244000">including social stimulation.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="246000" id="t-246000">So extroverts really crave large amounts of stimulation,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="249000" id="t-249000">whereas introverts feel at their most alive</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="251101" id="t-251101">and their most switched-on and their most capable</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="253501" id="t-253501">when they're in quieter, more low-key environments.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="255930" id="t-255930">Not all the time -- these things aren't absolute --</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="258383" id="t-258383">but a lot of the time.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="259600" id="t-259600">So the key then to maximizing our talents</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="264000" id="t-264000">is for us all to put ourselves</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="266000" id="t-266000">in the zone of stimulation that is right for us.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="269000" id="t-269000">But now here's where the bias comes in.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="271000" id="t-271000">Our most important institutions,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="273000" id="t-273000">our schools and our workplaces,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="275000" id="t-275000">they are designed mostly for extroverts</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="277000" id="t-277000">and for extroverts' need for lots of stimulation.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="280000" id="t-280000">And also we have this belief system right now</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="284000" id="t-284000">that I call the new groupthink,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="286000" id="t-286000">which holds that all creativity and all productivity</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="289000" id="t-289000">comes from a very oddly gregarious place.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="294000" id="t-294000">So if you picture the typical classroom nowadays:</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="296358" id="t-296358">When I was going to school, we sat in rows.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="300000" id="t-300000">We sat in rows of desks like this,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="302000" id="t-302000">and we did most of our work pretty autonomously.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="304287" id="t-304287">But nowadays, your typical classroom has pods of desks --</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="308000" id="t-308000">four or five or six or seven kids all facing each other.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="311000" id="t-311000">And kids are working in countless group assignments.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="313501" id="t-313501">Even in subjects like math and creative writing,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="316000" id="t-316000">which you think would depend on solo flights of thought,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="319000" id="t-319000">kids are now expected to act as committee members.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="323000" id="t-323000">And for the kids who prefer to go off by themselves or just to work alone,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="327215" id="t-327215">those kids are seen as outliers often</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="329100" id="t-329100">or, worse, as problem cases.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="333746" id="t-333746">And the vast majority of teachers</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="335646" id="t-335646">reports believing that the ideal student is an extrovert</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="338400" id="t-338400">as opposed to an introvert,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="340000" id="t-340000">even though introverts actually get better grades</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="342358" id="t-342358">and are more knowledgeable,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="344000" id="t-344000">according to research.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="346000" id="t-346000">(Laughter)</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="348000" id="t-348000">Okay, same thing is true in our workplaces.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="351000" id="t-351000">Now, most of us work in open plan offices,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="354000" id="t-354000">without walls,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="356000" id="t-356000">where we are subject to the constant noise and gaze of our coworkers.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="360310" id="t-360310">And when it comes to leadership,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="362000" id="t-362000">introverts are routinely passed over for leadership positions,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="365000" id="t-365000">even though introverts tend to be very careful,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="367240" id="t-367240">much less likely to take outsize risks --</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="369240" id="t-369240">which is something we might all favor nowadays.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="372000" id="t-372000">And interesting research by Adam Grant at the Wharton School</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="375000" id="t-375000">has found that introverted leaders</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="377000" id="t-377000">often deliver better outcomes than extroverts do,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="379358" id="t-379358">because when they are managing proactive employees,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="382000" id="t-382000">they're much more likely to let those employees run with their ideas,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="385287" id="t-385287">whereas an extrovert can, quite unwittingly,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="387407" id="t-387407">get so excited about things</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="389000" id="t-389000">that they're putting their own stamp on things,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="391240" id="t-391240">and other people's ideas might not as easily then bubble up to the surface.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="396000" id="t-396000">Now in fact, some of our transformative leaders in history have been introverts.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="399800" id="t-399800">I'll give you some examples.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="401200" id="t-401200">Eleanor Roosevelt, Rosa Parks, Gandhi --</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="404000" id="t-404000">all these peopled described themselves as quiet and soft-spoken and even shy.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="409000" id="t-409000">And they all took the spotlight,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="411000" id="t-411000">even though every bone in their bodies was telling them not to.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="416269" id="t-416269">And this turns out to have a special power all its own,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="418900" id="t-418900">because people could feel that these leaders were at the helm</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="421900" id="t-421900">not because they enjoyed directing others</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="423900" id="t-423900">and not out of the pleasure of being looked at;</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="426200" id="t-426200">they were there because they had no choice,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="428272" id="t-428272">because they were driven to do what they thought was right.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="431468" id="t-431468">Now I think at this point it's important for me to say</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="434100" id="t-434100">that I actually love extroverts.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="437000" id="t-437000">I always like to say some of my best friends are extroverts,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="440000" id="t-440000">including my beloved husband.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="444000" id="t-444000">And we all fall at different points, of course,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="446263" id="t-446263">along the introvert/extrovert spectrum.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="449000" id="t-449000">Even Carl Jung, the psychologist who first popularized these terms,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="452430" id="t-452430">said that there's no such thing as a pure introvert</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="454845" id="t-454845">or a pure extrovert.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="456200" id="t-456200">He said that such a man would be in a lunatic asylum,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="458748" id="t-458748">if he existed at all.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="461000" id="t-461000">And some people fall smack in the middle of the introvert/extrovert spectrum,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="465000" id="t-465000">and we call these people ambiverts.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="467000" id="t-467000">And I often think that they have the best of all worlds.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="470999" id="t-470999">But many of us do recognize ourselves as one type or the other.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="474000" id="t-474000">And what I'm saying is that culturally, we need a much better balance.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="477310" id="t-477310">We need more of a yin and yang between these two types.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="481000" id="t-481000">This is especially important</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="483000" id="t-483000">when it comes to creativity and to productivity,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="485310" id="t-485310">because when psychologists look at the lives of the most creative people,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="489000" id="t-489000">what they find</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="491000" id="t-491000">are people who are very good at exchanging ideas</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="493310" id="t-493310">and advancing ideas,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="495000" id="t-495000">but who also have a serious streak of introversion in them.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="498000" id="t-498000">And this is because solitude</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="500253" id="t-500253">is a crucial ingredient often to creativity.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="502400" id="t-502400">So Darwin,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="504000" id="t-504000">he took long walks alone in the woods</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="506000" id="t-506000">and emphatically turned down dinner-party invitations.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="509000" id="t-509000">Theodor Geisel, better known as Dr. Seuss,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="512000" id="t-512000">he dreamed up many of his amazing creations</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="514049" id="t-514049">in a lonely bell tower office that he had</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="516049" id="t-516049">in the back of his house in La Jolla, California.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="519000" id="t-519000">And he was actually afraid to meet the young children who read his books</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="523000" id="t-523000">for fear that they were expecting him this kind of jolly Santa Claus-like figure</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="527024" id="t-527024">and would be disappointed with his more reserved persona.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="531000" id="t-531000">Steve Wozniak invented the first Apple computer</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="533263" id="t-533263">sitting alone in his cubicle in Hewlett-Packard</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="536284" id="t-536284">where he was working at the time.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="537945" id="t-537945">And he says that he never would have become such an expert in the first place</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="541644" id="t-541644">had he not been too introverted to leave the house</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="544100" id="t-544100">when he was growing up.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="545808" id="t-545808">Now, of course,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="548000" id="t-548000">this does not mean that we should all stop collaborating --</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="551000" id="t-551000">and case in point, is Steve Wozniak famously coming together with Steve Jobs</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="554644" id="t-554644">to start Apple Computer --</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="557000" id="t-557000">but it does mean that solitude matters</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="560000" id="t-560000">and that for some people it is the air that they breathe.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="564000" id="t-564000">And in fact, we have known for centuries about the transcendent power of solitude.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="570000" id="t-570000">It's only recently that we've strangely begun to forget it.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="573000" id="t-573000">If you look at most of the world's major religions,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="576000" id="t-576000">you will find seekers --</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="578000" id="t-578000">Moses, Jesus, Buddha, Muhammad --</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="581000" id="t-581000">seekers who are going off by themselves alone to the wilderness,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="585000" id="t-585000">where they then have profound epiphanies and revelations</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="587700" id="t-587700">that they then bring back to the rest of the community.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="590400" id="t-590400">So, no wilderness, no revelations.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="594000" id="t-594000">This is no surprise, though,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="596000" id="t-596000">if you look at the insights of contemporary psychology.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="599000" id="t-599000">It turns out that we can't even be in a group of people</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="602000" id="t-602000">without instinctively mirroring, mimicking their opinions.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="605000" id="t-605000">Even about seemingly personal and visceral things</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="607358" id="t-607358">like who you're attracted to,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="609000" id="t-609000">you will start aping the beliefs of the people around you</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="612000" id="t-612000">without even realizing that that's what you're doing.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="614548" id="t-614548">And groups famously follow the opinions</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="617000" id="t-617000">of the most dominant or charismatic person in the room,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="619700" id="t-619700">even though there's zero correlation</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="621500" id="t-621500">between being the best talker and having the best ideas --</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="624300" id="t-624300">I mean zero.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="626000" id="t-626000">So --</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="628000" id="t-628000">(Laughter)</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="630000" id="t-630000">You might be following the person with the best ideas,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="633000" id="t-633000">but you might not.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="635000" id="t-635000">And do you really want to leave it up to chance?</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="638000" id="t-638000">Much better for everybody to go off by themselves,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="640405" id="t-640405">generate their own ideas</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="642000" id="t-642000">freed from the distortions of group dynamics,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="644167" id="t-644167">and then come together as a team</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="646000" id="t-646000">to talk them through in a well-managed environment</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="649000" id="t-649000">and take it from there.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="651000" id="t-651000">Now if all this is true,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="653000" id="t-653000">then why are we getting it so wrong?</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="656000" id="t-656000">Why are we setting up our schools this way, and our workplaces?</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="659000" id="t-659000">And why are we making these introverts feel so guilty</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="661548" id="t-661548">about wanting to just go off by themselves some of the time?</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="664500" id="t-664500">One answer lies deep in our cultural history.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="667000" id="t-667000">Western societies,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="669000" id="t-669000">and in particular the U.S.,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="671000" id="t-671000">have always favored the man of action over the "man" of contemplation.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="679000" id="t-679000">But in America's early days,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="682000" id="t-682000">we lived in what historians call a culture of character,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="685000" id="t-685000">where we still, at that point, valued people</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="687120" id="t-687120">for their inner selves and their moral rectitude.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="690000" id="t-690000">And if you look at the self-help books from this era,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="692600" id="t-692600">they all had titles with things like</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="694400" id="t-694400">"Character, the Grandest Thing in the World."</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="697000" id="t-697000">And they featured role models like Abraham Lincoln,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="700000" id="t-700000">who was praised for being modest and unassuming.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="702310" id="t-702310">Ralph Waldo Emerson called him</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="704000" id="t-704000">"A man who does not offend by superiority."</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="707000" id="t-707000">But then we hit the 20th century,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="710000" id="t-710000">and we entered a new culture</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="712000" id="t-712000">that historians call the culture of personality.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="714287" id="t-714287">What happened is we had evolved an agricultural economy</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="716987" id="t-716987">to a world of big business.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="718400" id="t-718400">And so suddenly people are moving from small towns to the cities.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="722000" id="t-722000">And instead of working alongside people they've known all their lives,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="725335" id="t-725335">now they are having to prove themselves in a crowd of strangers.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="729000" id="t-729000">So, quite understandably,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="731000" id="t-731000">qualities like magnetism and charisma suddenly come to seem really important.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="735000" id="t-735000">And sure enough, the self-help books change to meet these new needs</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="738215" id="t-738215">and they start to have names</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="740000" id="t-740000">like "How to Win Friends and Influence People."</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="742240" id="t-742240">And they feature as their role models really great salesmen.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="747000" id="t-747000">So that's the world we're living in today.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="749024" id="t-749024">That's our cultural inheritance.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="753000" id="t-753000">Now none of this is to say that social skills are unimportant,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="758000" id="t-758000">and I'm also not calling for the abolishing of teamwork at all.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="763000" id="t-763000">The same religions who send their sages off to lonely mountain tops</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="766215" id="t-766215">also teach us love and trust.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="769000" id="t-769000">And the problems that we are facing today</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="771000" id="t-771000">in fields like science and in economics</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="773000" id="t-773000">are so vast and so complex</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="775000" id="t-775000">that we are going to need armies of people coming together</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="777800" id="t-777800">to solve them working together.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="779400" id="t-779400">But I am saying that the more freedom that we give introverts to be themselves,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="783200" id="t-783200">the more likely that they are</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="784700" id="t-784700">to come up with their own unique solutions to these problems.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="789000" id="t-789000">So now I'd like to share with you what's in my suitcase today.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="798000" id="t-798000">Guess what?</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="800000" id="t-800000">Books.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="802000" id="t-802000">I have a suitcase full of books.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="804000" id="t-804000">Here's Margaret Atwood, "Cat's Eye."</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="806000" id="t-806000">Here's a novel by Milan Kundera.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="809000" id="t-809000">And here's "The Guide for the Perplexed" by Maimonides.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="814000" id="t-814000">But these are not exactly my books.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="817000" id="t-817000">I brought these books with me</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="819000" id="t-819000">because they were written by my grandfather's favorite authors.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="823000" id="t-823000">My grandfather was a rabbi</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="825000" id="t-825000">and he was a widower</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="827000" id="t-827000">who lived alone in a small apartment in Brooklyn</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="830000" id="t-830000">that was my favorite place in the world when I was growing up,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="833000" id="t-833000">partly because it was filled with his very gentle, very courtly presence</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="836453" id="t-836453">and partly because it was filled with books.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="839000" id="t-839000">I mean literally every table, every chair in this apartment</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="842000" id="t-842000">had yielded its original function</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="844000" id="t-844000">to now serve as a surface for swaying stacks of books.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="847000" id="t-847000">Just like the rest of my family,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="849000" id="t-849000">my grandfather's favorite thing to do in the whole world was to read.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="852310" id="t-852310">But he also loved his congregation,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="855000" id="t-855000">and you could feel this love in the sermons that he gave</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="858000" id="t-858000">every week for the 62 years that he was a rabbi.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="862000" id="t-862000">He would takes the fruits of each week's reading</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="865000" id="t-865000">and he would weave</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="866336" id="t-866336">these intricate tapestries of ancient and humanist thought.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="869201" id="t-869201">And people would come from all over to hear him speak.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="872703" id="t-872703">But here's the thing about my grandfather.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="876067" id="t-876067">Underneath this ceremonial role,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="877700" id="t-877700">he was really modest and really introverted --</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="880000" id="t-880000">so much so that when he delivered these sermons,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="883000" id="t-883000">he had trouble making eye contact</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="885000" id="t-885000">with the very same congregation that he had been speaking to for 62 years.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="889024" id="t-889024">And even away from the podium,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="891000" id="t-891000">when you called him to say hello,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="893000" id="t-893000">he would often end the conversation prematurely</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="895263" id="t-895263">for fear that he was taking up too much of your time.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="899000" id="t-899000">But when he died at the age of 94,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="902000" id="t-902000">the police had to close down the streets of his neighborhood</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="905000" id="t-905000">to accommodate the crowd of people who came out to mourn him.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="911846" id="t-911846">And so these days I try to learn from my grandfather's example</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="914900" id="t-914900">in my own way.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="916300" id="t-916300">So I just published a book about introversion,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="919000" id="t-919000">and it took me about seven years to write.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="921024" id="t-921024">And for me, that seven years was like total bliss,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="924000" id="t-924000">because I was reading, I was writing,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="927000" id="t-927000">I was thinking, I was researching.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="929000" id="t-929000">It was my version</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="931000" id="t-931000">of my grandfather's hours of the day alone in his library.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="934000" id="t-934000">But now all of a sudden my job is very different,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="937000" id="t-937000">and my job is to be out here talking about it,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="940000" id="t-940000">talking about introversion.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="943000" id="t-943000">(Laughter)</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="947000" id="t-947000">And that's a lot harder for me,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="949000" id="t-949000">because as honored as I am to be here with all of you right now,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="953000" id="t-953000">this is not my natural milieu.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="956000" id="t-956000">So I prepared for moments like these as best I could.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="960000" id="t-960000">I spent the last year practicing public speaking</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="962310" id="t-962310">every chance I could get.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="964000" id="t-964000">And I call this my "year of speaking dangerously."</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="967000" id="t-967000">(Laughter)</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="969000" id="t-969000">And that actually helped a lot.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="971000" id="t-971000">But I'll tell you, what helps even more</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="973000" id="t-973000">is my sense, my belief, my hope that when it comes to our attitudes</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="978000" id="t-978000">to introversion and to quiet and to solitude,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="980144" id="t-980144">we truly are poised on the brink on dramatic change.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="982645" id="t-982645">I mean, we are.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="984000" id="t-984000">And so I am going to leave you now</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="986000" id="t-986000">with three calls for action for those who share this vision.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="990000" id="t-990000">Number one:</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="992000" id="t-992000">Stop the madness for constant group work.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="994000" id="t-994000">Just stop it.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="996000" id="t-996000">(Laughter)</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="999000" id="t-999000">Thank you.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1001000" id="t-1001000">(Applause)</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1003000" id="t-1003000">And I want to be clear about what I'm saying,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1005167" id="t-1005167">because I deeply believe our offices</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1007000" id="t-1007000">should be encouraging casual, chatty cafe-style types of interactions --</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1011000" id="t-1011000">you know, the kind where people come together</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1013144" id="t-1013144">and serendipitously have an exchange of ideas.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1015359" id="t-1015359">That is great.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1017000" id="t-1017000">It's great for introverts and it's great for extroverts.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1019700" id="t-1019700">But we need much more privacy and much more freedom</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1022153" id="t-1022153">and much more autonomy at work.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1023700" id="t-1023700">School, same thing.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1025000" id="t-1025000">We need to be teaching kids to work together, for sure,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1028000" id="t-1028000">but we also need to be teaching them how to work on their own.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1031000" id="t-1031000">This is especially important for extroverted children too.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1033800" id="t-1033800">They need to work on their own</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1035300" id="t-1035300">because that is where deep thought comes from in part.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1037896" id="t-1037896">Okay, number two: Go to the wilderness.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1040000" id="t-1040000">Be like Buddha, have your own revelations.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1043000" id="t-1043000">I'm not saying</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1045000" id="t-1045000">that we all have to now go off and build our own cabins in the woods</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1048263" id="t-1048263">and never talk to each other again,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1051000" id="t-1051000">but I am saying that we could all stand to unplug</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1053358" id="t-1053358">and get inside our own heads a little more often.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1059000" id="t-1059000">Number three:</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1062000" id="t-1062000">Take a good look at what's inside your own suitcase</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1064453" id="t-1064453">and why you put it there.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1066000" id="t-1066000">So extroverts,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1068000" id="t-1068000">maybe your suitcases are also full of books.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1070097" id="t-1070097">Or maybe they're full of champagne glasses or skydiving equipment.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1075000" id="t-1075000">Whatever it is, I hope you take these things out every chance you get</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1079000" id="t-1079000">and grace us with your energy and your joy.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1082000" id="t-1082000">But introverts, you being you,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1085000" id="t-1085000">you probably have the impulse to guard very carefully</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1087578" id="t-1087578">what's inside your own suitcase.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1089478" id="t-1089478">And that's okay.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1091000" id="t-1091000">But occasionally, just occasionally,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1093000" id="t-1093000">I hope you will open up your suitcases for other people to see,</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1096024" id="t-1096024">because the world needs you and it needs the things you carry.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1101000" id="t-1101000">So I wish you the best of all possible journeys</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1103263" id="t-1103263">and the courage to speak softly.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1106000" id="t-1106000">Thank you very much.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1108000" id="t-1108000">(Applause)</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1112000" id="t-1112000">Thank you. Thank you.</span>
<span class="talk-transcript__fragment" data-time="1115000" id="t-1115000">(Applause)</span>
